\section{Open Issues}

Once we have moved the hardware to the summit, there will still be a number of things which still need
to be addressed:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The relationship of the \CC with the camera diagnostic cluster.
\item
  The degree to which the \CC can rely on a network connection to the USDF.
\item
  \CC's needs for disk now that it's not co-located with the CDC.
\end{itemize}
